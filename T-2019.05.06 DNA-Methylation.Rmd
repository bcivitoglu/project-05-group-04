## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Legend

df = data frame

##Read in the data

input_data <- readRDS(file ="CLL-Bcells_list.RDS.gz")

annotation <- read.csv("sample_annotation.csv")

##Divide the data in 3 subgroups

genes <- input_data$genes

promoters <- input_data$promoters

cpgislands <- input_data$cpgislands

### Rename a column

# If you know the number of the column
names(genes)[number_of_col] <- "new_name"

#If you have too many columns to know the number
colnames(genes)[colnames(genes)=="old_name"] <- "new_name"

###Show if columns have missing values

sum(is.na(df))
--> Number of missing values is shown as result

# Set NA´s to a defined number

df[is.na(df)] <- set_number
genes$Symbol[is.na(genes$Symbol)] <- 0

# Set 0 to NA

df[df == 0] <- NA
genes$Symbol[genes$Symbol == 0] <- NA

### Histogram for CpG derivation

hist(df, main = "Headline", xlab = "Name of x-axis", xlim = c(Starting_Number, Ending_Number), breaks = How_Many_Intervalls)

hist(cpgislands$CpG, main = "Histogram for CpG derivation", xlab = "Number of CpG´s in Region", xlim = c(0,600), breaks = 200)

### Density plot for CpG derivation

plot(df), xlab = "X-axis name", main = "",xlim = c(Starting_Number, Ending_Number))

plot(density(genes$CpG), xlab = "Number of CpG´s", main = "",xlim = c(0,2000))
