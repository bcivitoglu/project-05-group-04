## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.






#Start the project

##Legend

df = data frame

## To make sure which file on my computer offers the environment for my R project:

getwd()

#Read in the data

input_data <- readRDS(file ="CLL-Bcells_list.RDS.gz")

annotation <- read.csv("sample_annotation.csv")

##Divide the data in 3 subgroups

genes <- input_data$genes

promoters <- input_data$promoters

cpgislands <- input_data$cpgislands

# Rename a column

## If you know the number of the columns

names(df)[number_of_col] <- "new_name"
E.g: names(genes)[1] <- "new_name"

##If you have too many columns to know the number

colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="old_name"] <- "new_name"
E.g: colnames(genes)[colnames(genes)=="old_name"] <- "new_name"

#Show if columns have missing values

sum(is.na(df))
--> Number of missing values is shown as result

# Set NA큦 to a defined number

df[is.na(df)] <- set_number
E.g.: genes$Symbol[is.na(genes$Symbol)] <- 0

# Set 0 to NA

df[df == 0] <- NA
E.g.: genes$Symbol[genes$Symbol == 0] <- NA

# Create new data frames with selected columns

## Create a data frame with selected columns using indices

dfnew1 <- genes[,c(1,2,3,4,5)]

## Create a data frame with selected columns using indices (easier)

dfnew2 <- genes [, c(1:5)]

## Create a data frame using the names of the columns

dfnew1 <- data.frame(df$subpoint1, df$subpoint2)
E.g.: dfnew1 <- data.frame(genes$Chromosome, genes$CpG)

### Rename all the (old) columns at once ("Chromosome" --> "Chr" ; "CpG" --> "CpG큦")

names(dfnew1) <- c("Chr", "CpG 큦")

## Histogram (for CpG derivation)

hist(df, main = "Headline", xlab = "Name of x-axis", xlim = c(Starting_Number, Ending_Number), breaks = How_Many_Intervalls)

hist(cpgislands$CpG, main = "Histogram for CpG derivation", xlab = "Number of CpG큦 in Region", xlim = c(0,600), breaks = 200)

## Density plot (for CpG derivation)

plot(df), xlab = "X-axis name", main = "",xlim = c(Starting_Number, Ending_Number))

plot(density(genes$CpG), xlab = "Number of CpG큦", main = "",xlim = c(0,2000))

## Boxplots (+modify)

boxplot(df1,df2)

boxplot(df1,df2, xlab = "Example_1", horizontal = T, ylim = c(0,1), ylab = "Non-cancer vs. CLL")
